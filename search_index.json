If you&#39;re looking for pure API docs like signatures, head over to the API Reference section.\n\nEpics\nSettings Up The Middleware\n\n"},"docs/basics/Epics.html":{"url":"docs/basics/Epics.html","title":"Epics","body":"Epics\n\nNot familiar with Observables/RxJS v5?\nredux-observable requires an understanding of Observables with RxJS v5. If you&#39;re new to Reactive Programming with RxJS v5, head over to http://reactivex.io/rxjs/ to familiarize yourself first.\n\nAn Epic is the core primitive of redux-observable.\nIt is a function which takes a stream of actions and returns a stream of actions. Actions in, actions out.\nYou can think of it of having roughly this type signature:\nfunction (action$: Observable&lt;Action&gt;, store: Store): Observable&lt;Action&gt;;\n\nWhile you&#39;ll most commonly produce actions out in response to some action you received in, keep in mind that&#39;s not actually a requirement! Once you&#39;re inside your Epic, use any Observable patterns you desire as long as anything output from the outermost stream is an action.\nThe actions you emit will be immediately dispatched through the normal store.dispatch(), so under the hood redux-observable effectively does epic(actions$, store).subscribe(store.dispatch)\n\nThe pattern of handling side effects this way is similar to the process manager pattern, often incorrectly described as a saga. If you&#39;re familiar with redux-saga, redux-observable is very similar. But because it uses RxJS it is much more declarative and you utilize and expand your existing RxJS abilities.\n\nKeep in mind that letting an incoming action pass through transparently will create an infinite loop:\n// DO NOT DO THIS\nconst actionEpic = (action$) =&gt; action$; // creates infinite loop\n\nA Basic Example\n\nredux-observable does not automatically add every RxJS operator to the Observable prototype. Because there are many ways to add them, our examples will not include any imports. If you want to add every operator, put import &#39;rxjs&#39;; in your entry index.js.\n\nLet&#39;s start with a simple Epic example:\nconst pingEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.filter(action =&gt; action.type === &#39;PING&#39;)\n    .mapTo({ type: &#39;PONG&#39; });\n\n// later...\ndispatch({ type: &#39;PING&#39; });\n\n\nNoticed how action$ has a dollar sign at the end? It&#39;s simply a common RxJS convention to identify variables that reference a stream.\n\npingEpic will listen for actions of type PING and map them to a new action, PONG. This example is functionally equivalent to doing this:\ndispatch({ type: &#39;PING&#39; });\ndispatch({ type: &#39;PONG&#39; });\n\n\nEpics run alongside the normal Redux dispatch channel, after the reducers have received them, so you cannot &quot;swallow&quot; an incoming action. When you map one of those actions to another, you&#39;re not preventing the original action from reaching the reducers; that action has already been through them!\n\nThe real power starts to reveal itself when you need to do something asynchronous. Let&#39;s say you want to dispatch PONG 1 second after receiving the PING:\nconst pingEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.filter(action =&gt; action.type === &#39;PING&#39;)\n    .delay(1000) // Asynchronously wait 1000ms then continue\n    .mapTo({ type: &#39;PONG&#39; });\n\n// later...\ndispatch({ type: &#39;PING&#39; });\n\nYour reducers will receive the original PING action, then 1 second later receive the PONG.\nconst pingReducer = (state = { isPinging: false }, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case &#39;PING&#39;:\n      return { isPinging: true };\n\n    case &#39;PONG&#39;:\n      return { isPinging: false };\n\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nSince filtering by a specific action type is so common, the actions stream redux-observable gives you is a special ActionsObservable which has a custom ofType() operator to reduce that boilerplate:\nconst pingEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.ofType(&#39;PING&#39;)\n    .delay(1000) // Asynchronously wait 1000ms then continue\n    .mapTo({ type: &#39;PONG&#39; });\n\n\nTry It Live!\nView this demo on JSBin\nA Real World Example\nNow that we have a general idea of what an Epic looks like, let&#39;s continue with a more real-world example:\n// action creators\nconst fetchUser = username =&gt; ({ type: FETCH_USER, payload: username });\nconst fetchUserFulfilled = payload =&gt; ({ type: FETCH_USER_FULFILLED, payload });\n\n// epic\nconst fetchUserEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.ofType(FETCH_USER)\n    .mergeMap(action =&gt;\n      ajax.getJSON(`https://api.github.com/users/${action.payload}`)\n        .map(fetchUserFulfilled)\n    );\n\n// later...\ndispatch(fetchUser(&#39;torvalds&#39;));\n\n\nWe&#39;re using action creators (aka factories) like fetchUser instead of creating the action POJO directly. This is a Redux convention that is totally optional.\n\nWe have a standard Redux action creator fetchUser, but also a corresponding Epic to orchestrate the actual AJAX call. When that AJAX call comes back, we map the response to a FETCH_USER_FULFILLED action.\n\nRemember, Epics take stream of actions in and return a stream of actions out. If the RxJS operators and behavior shown so far is unfamiliar to you, you&#39;ll definitely want to take some time to dive deeper into RxJS before proceeding.\n\nYou can then update your Store&#39;s state in response to that FETCH_USER_FULFILLED action:\nconst users = (state = {}, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case FETCH_USER_FULFILLED:\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        // `login` is the username\n        [action.payload.login]: action.payload\n      };\n\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\n\nTry It Live!\nView this demo on JSBin\nAccessing the Store&#39;s State\nYour Epics receive a second argument, the Redux store itself.\nfunction (action$: Observable&lt;Action&gt;, store: Store): Observable&lt;Action&gt;;\n\nWith this, you can call store.getState() to synchronously access the current state:\nconst INCREMENT = &#39;INCREMENT&#39;;\nconst INCREMENT_IF_ODD = &#39;INCREMENT_IF_ODD&#39;;\n\nconst increment = () =&gt; ({ type: INCREMENT });\nconst incrementIfOdd = () =&gt; ({ type: INCREMENT_IF_ODD });\n\nconst incrementIfOddEpic = (action$, store) =&gt;\n  action$.ofType(INCREMENT_IF_ODD)\n    .filter(() =&gt; store.getState().counter % 2 === 0)\n    .map(increment);\n\n// later...\ndispatch(incrementIfOdd());\n\n\nWhen an Epic receives an action, it has already been run through your reducers and the state updated, if needed.\n\nRemember, store.getState() is just an imperative, synchronous API. You cannot treat it as a stream as-is.\n\nTry It Live!\nView this demo on JSBinn\nCombining Epics\nFinally, redux-observable provides a utility called combineEpics() that allows you to easily combine multiple Epics into a single one:\nimport { combineEpics } from &#39;redux-observable&#39;;\n\nconst rootEpic = combineEpics(\n  pingEpic,\n  fetchUserEpic\n);\n\nNote that this is equivalent to:\nimport { merge } from &#39;rxjs/observable/merge&#39;;\n\nconst rootEpic = (action$, store) =&gt; merge(\n  pingEpic(action$, store),\n  fetchUserEpic(action$, store)\n);\n\nNext Steps\nNext, weâ€™ll explore how to activate your Epics so they can start listening for actions.\n"},"docs/basics/SettingUpTheMiddleware.html":{"url":"docs/basics/SettingUpTheMiddleware.html","title":"Settings Up The Middleware","body":"Setting Up The Middleware\nNow that we know what Epics are, we need to provide them to the redux-observable middleware so they can start listening for actions.\nRoot Epic\nJust like redux requiring a single root Reducer, redux-observable also requires you to have a single root Epic.

Because we don&#39;t want to confuse people with two options that in many use cases are functionally equivalent, we decided to eventually remove thunkservables completely.

It is not a full version of the store, so it does not support the Symbol.observable interop point to allow Observable.from(store). You can learn more about this here.\n\nTypeError: Cannot read property &#39;subscribe&#39; of undefined\nThis almost always means you&#39;re using an operator somewhere that expects to be provided with an observable but you instead did not give it anything at all. Often, you may be passing a variable but it is unknowingly set to undefined, so step through a debugger to confirm.\nHappens from combineEpics()\nUsually this means you&#39;re not returning an observable from one or more of your Epics.
